OpenGL-Array version 0.70_02
============================

This is a stand-alone distribution of OpenGL::Array
(which includes OpenGL::Matrix).  All of these were
implicitly loaded whenever the Perl OpenGL module was use-d.

This module should be compatible with OpenGL::Array
and OpenGL::Matrix from Perl OpenGL version 0.70 and can
be used as a replacement for that functionality.

The separate release is to enable backwards and forwards
compatibility between the legacy OpenGL module functionality
and the coming OpenGL::Modern module under development.
